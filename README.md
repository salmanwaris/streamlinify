# Streamlinify Work-Life Organized

This Application is called “Streamlinify-Work Life Organized”. Today on average any company comprising of hundreds if not thousands of employees suffer from chaos of managing their e-mails or communication in general. If we assume that each employee sends at least 30 e-mails in a day then after calculating there are around 300,000 emails a day in a single Organization. For organizations to communicate both as a group and in personal one-on-one discussions efficiently, making working and collaborating streamlined across organization. Designing a Web Application using ReactJS and Firebase where information is not lost in e-mails. If we ask employers and employees about what is not happening correctly in their respective organizations the answer would range somewhere between improper communication and information getting lost on a daily basis where the problem is not that the information and communication is not reaching the receiver but not being organized correctly. Multitude of information at any given time is being sent and received from different departments and the particular information required by the employee somewhere gets lost.   
AIM
The main goal of our project is to make communication in an organization, both as a group or even personal one-to-one as efficient and hassle-free as possible. We intend to replace E-mails within an organization and bring all information for a particular Topic, Discussion or Project under a single dedicated channel.
